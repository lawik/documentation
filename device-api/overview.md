# Overview

Devices connect to NervesHub via the Device API. The Device API consists of a persistence Phoenix channel.

NervesHub authenticates device connections via client-side certifications.

The [`nerves_hub_link`](https://github.com/nerves-hub/nerves\_hub\_link) libraries implement the Device API and can download and install firmware updates.
